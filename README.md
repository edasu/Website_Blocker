# Website_Blocker

<p> We can open that as a file via Python. Using file handling methods and we can add lines of text at certain times of the day and this host file. For instance let's say I work between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. In that case I'll write a Python script that runs the entire day and checks every let's say every five minutes it checks the time. And if it's past 4:00 p.m. then it will delete these two lines. But if you are between 08:00 and 16:00 Python on will add these two lines in this host file and the host file will block access to these two websites.

<p> We need to use python to open files and write specific websites that now allow us to access those.
